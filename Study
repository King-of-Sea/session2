1.1 var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped. var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope;
let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared
1.2 var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript but the difference between them is that var is function scoped and let is block scoped.
It can be said that a variable declared with var is defined throughout the program as compared to let.
1.3 const is a signal that the identifier won't be reassigned. `let` is a signal that the variable may be reassigned, such as a counter in a loop, or a value swap in an algorithm.
It also signals that the variable will be used only in the block it's defined in, which is not always the entire containing function.
1.4 var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.
var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.
2.1 Any kind of logic, function, expression, or theory based on the work of George Boole is considered Boolean.
Boolean data type, a form of data with only two possible values (usually "true" and "false")
2.2 A boolean expression is an expression that results in a boolean value, that is, in a value of either true or false .
